# Customer Churn Prediction for a Telecom Company

This project is about predicting customer churn for a telecom company using **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** algorithms. This is an end to end machine learning project with deployment using flask api .

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will churn or not. The project involves several steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: The raw data is cleaned to remove any inconsistencies and prepare it for further analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA is performed to understand the data and find patterns, relationships, or anomalies to inform our model.

3. **Feature Engineering**: New features are created from the existing data to improve the performance of the machine learning model.

4. **Encoding**: Categorical variables are encoded to numerical values which can be used in our machine learning model.

5. **Model Development**: A machine learning model is developed using **Random Forest** and **Decision Tree** algorithms.

6. **Model Deployment**: The model is deployed using a Flask API with a UI interface. This allows the client to enter the customer data directly and get the prediction whether the customer will churn or not.
